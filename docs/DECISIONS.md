# DECISIONS

One short entry per non-obvious technical or product decision. Newest first. Format: date · decision · why · who.

## 2026-10-30 — Build strategy (owner)

Public frontend design is unconfirmed, so: backend first, then dashboards, then registration/payment perfected, public marketing site last. Details and Definition of Done: `10-BUILD-PLAN.md`.

## 2026-10-30 — Scaffold decisions (Claude, for owner review)

1. **pnpm monorepo, single folder** (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/ui`, `packages/shared`). Why: owner works in one folder; shared types/UI; one lockfile.
2. **Prisma 6.19, not 7/8.** Prisma "latest" on npm is a release candidate (8.0.0-rc) and 7.x changes the datasource config model. 6.19 is stable and matches the rulebook's `?pgbouncer=true` + `DIRECT_URL` guidance. Revisit after launch.
3. **`@sirat/shared` is compiled (CommonJS `dist/`)**, `@sirat/ui` is source-consumed by Next (`transpilePackages`). Why: Nest runs compiled CJS and cannot import TS source from a workspace package. Run `pnpm --filter @sirat/shared build` before api/web builds (CI must do this).
4. **Fonts self-hosted via fontsource**, not `next/font/google`. Why: no external request at build or runtime; Bangla support; the sandbox blocked Google Fonts and production builds should not depend on it.
5. **Tailwind v4 tokens in `packages/ui/src/styles/tokens.css`.** Brand colors copied from the old site: Primary `#E3621C`, Secondary `#083E5F`. Indigo/violet from old pages intentionally dropped.
6. **Session lifetime 7 days** (refresh), access token 15 min. The rulebook said 14–30 days; owner decided 7 days. `REFRESH_TTL_DAYS=7`.
7. **SDG removed.** Categories Activist/Ambassador/Achiever kept (grade bands to confirm). `assigned_sdg_number` and SDG topics are not in the schema.
8. **Rounds are data (`rounds`, `round_entries`)**, not `round_1..3` columns.
9. **Registration is pay-then-account** like the old flow, but form data is stored server-side in `pending_registrations`, and account creation happens inside the transaction that marks the payment paid. Why: fixes old C4 (one payment → many accounts) and the lost-form-data bug.
10. **Email verification: lazy (proposed).** Login allowed, exam start requires a verified email. Needs owner confirmation.
11. **Throttler is in-memory in the scaffold** (`ThrottlerModule.forRoot`). TODO before launch: Redis storage + per-route limits. Tracked in `04-FEATURES.md` build order step 2.
12. **Prisma client could not be generated in the scaffold sandbox** (engine download from `binaries.prisma.sh` returned 403). Schema was validated with the Prisma schema validator instead; `generate`/`migrate` must be run on a normal machine first.
13. **`reference/` holds the old UI + server source** for porting. `.env` files and public assets were excluded on purpose.
